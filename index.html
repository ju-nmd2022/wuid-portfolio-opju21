        <h2>Why NMD?</h2>
        <p>
          Well funny story, i first got into a two-year furniture education but
          after checking again i got in to this program by being a reserve. So i
          live a bit away but have really enjoyed this program and dont really
          mind the commute to school. Except when it starts at eight in the
          morning, then i will be late because my train gets to Jönköping by
          eight.
