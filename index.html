          <h2>Why NMD?</h2>
          <p class="multi-column">
            Well funny story, i first got into a two-year furniture education
            but after checking again i got in to this program by being a
            reserve. So i live a bit away but have really enjoyed this program
            and dont really mind the commute to school. Except when it starts at
            eight in the morning, then i will be late because my train gets to
            Jönköping by eight.
